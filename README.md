# Predicting-Loan-Defaults

This group project aims to understand the behaviour of financial institutions in regards to Loan Approvals or Denials and Loan Payment Difficulties. Given a dataset that includes many features and attributes of about ~300,000 loan applicants, we proceeded by analyzing these applicants and applying several machine learning algorithms and models in order to gain insight into the financial facet of loans. There seems to be many factors that affect the prospect of approving a loan, and our project dives more into understanding these underlying depths. At the end of the project, we will have developed some models that are able to predict whether an applicant will end up having difficulties in paying back the loan or not based on a number of features.
